    <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.
It affects tides on Earth due to its gravitational pull.
The Moon has no atmosphere, so there's no weather or sound.
It goes through phases every ~29.5 days, from New Moon to Full Moon.
Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 (Apollo 11).
It always shows one face to Earth due to synchronous rotation.The Moon is the brightest object in our night sky and has a strong influence on Earth. It controls ocean tides and plays an important role in balancing the Earth's rotation. The Moon has many craters because it has no atmosphere to protect it from meteoroids. It takes about 27.3 days to orbit Earth and shows different phases during this time. Though it looks bright, the Moon doesn’t shine by itself — it reflects sunlight.
